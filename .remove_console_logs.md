This commit removes console.log calls from several files as requested.

Files edited:
- client/src/lib/analyzeFood.ts
- server/vite.ts
- client/src/pages/Scanner.tsx
- client/src/pages/Profile.tsx
- client/src/pages/History.tsx

Notes:
- console.warn and console.error are preserved.
- server/vite.ts `log` now uses `viteLogger.info` instead of `console.log`.
